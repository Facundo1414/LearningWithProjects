  //  The number 12 is the first number in having six divisors, they are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.
//  Your challenge for this kata is to find the minimum number that has a certain number of divisors. For this purpose we have to create the function
    //    find_min_num() or findMinNum() or similar in the other languages
      //  that receives the wanted number of divisors num_div, and outputs the smallest number having an amount of divisors equals to num_div.
